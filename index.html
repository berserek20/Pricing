                    The best structure for solo entrepreneurs looking beyond the opportunities a sole proprietorship
                    affords. Here, a single promoter gains full authority over the company, restricting his/her lability
                    towards their contributions to the enterprise. The said person will be the sole shareholder and
                    director.
